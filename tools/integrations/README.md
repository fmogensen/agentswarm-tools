# Integrations

This category is reserved for future external service integrations and third-party API tools.

## Purpose

The `integrations/` directory will house tools that integrate with external platforms and services that don't fit into the other core categories (media, content, data, communication, infrastructure).

## Examples of Future Tools

- CRM integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Project management (Jira, Asana, Monday.com)
- E-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce)
- Payment processors (Stripe, PayPal)
- Social media APIs (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Marketing automation (Mailchimp, SendGrid)
- Analytics platforms (Google Analytics, Mixpanel)

## Status

Currently empty - tools will be added as needed.
